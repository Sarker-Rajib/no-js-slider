                            Elias, your singing was great! It helped make our day more special than it already was and
                            it
                            was truly a blessing to have you sing at our wedding. The hymns were perfectly sung and your
                            voice is amazing! Thank you so much for being present at the most important day of our life.
                        </p>

                            Highly recommend Elias! The wedding singer I originally had booked in cancelled due to
                            personal
                            reasons and Elias was amazing to deal with as a stressed bride at the time! I had all my
                            trust
                            in him. Elias and Priscilla's voice complemented each other and sounded perfect together -
                            they
                            performed beautifully. My husband and I couldnâ€™t have been happier! Thank you to Elias and
                            his
                            team for coming to the rescue. God bless you always!

                            Elias Eltarraf was an excellent addition to our wedding ceremony. He was so helpful in the
                            lead
                            up to the wedding. Any questions we had always received an immediate reply and on the day of
                            our
                            wedding he sounded amazing. His professionalism in his work was out of this world. I would
                            definitely recommend Elias to any couples looking for a singer for their ceremony.

                            I'm so pleased to have sought Elias to MC our function. Thank you for bringing people
                            together
                            on the day. Your professionalism and articulation was a beautiful touch. You kept the crowd
                            attentive throughout the day and left a lasting impression. We received tremendous feedback
                            and
                            are overjoyed. I am truly grateful for the love and passion you put into making this an
                            amazing
                            and memorable event. The day wouldn't have been complete without you.
